Identifying fraudulent health claims using Neural Networks, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Gradient Boost.

Increasing healthcare cost has been blocking several people from affording a health insurance (Gunja & Collins). One among the many reasons that attribute to the increase in heatlh care cost is healthcare fraud. Healthcare frauds cause the healthcare cost to increase (Davis).  An investigation done by Medicare Fraud Strike Force in 2012 across 7 cities found false claims amounting to $452 millions (Department ofp; District of Michigan).

Research Questions

There are many implications of an improperly functioning and improperly utilized healthcare system. To address these potential concerns and highlight the capabilities of our dataset, we have formulated a select group of questions to incorporate into our research. These questions would help us investigate the few main factors of claims fraud and the following analysis in the question would give us the viable solutions to recommend that would detect fraudulent claims. 
1) Is any given claim fraudulent? 
Here, we utilize modeling to predict if a new claim is fraudulent based on our given historical healthcare data. Detecting any new fraudulent claim is the key step to avoiding the fraud and detecting if the claim is fraudulent can help avoid it immediately. 
2) How do the demographics of a claim influence fraud?
This includes age group, gender, and geographical location of users who attempt to submit fraudulent claims. 
3) Do procedural codes influence fraud?
With a narrowed focus on specific healthcare issues susceptible to fraud, precautionary checks and procedures can be implemented within these specific healthcare fields (procedural codes) to strengthen the legitimacy of claim submissions.
